# Codebase Summary

## Overview
This project is an admin panel for a Learning Management System (LMS), built using Next.js with the App Router. It provides functionalities for managing various aspects of the LMS, including users, academic content, assessments, and system settings. The application uses TypeScript for static typing and relies heavily on Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for the user interface.

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Core Structure (`src/app`)
- **Layouts (`layout.tsx`):** Define the overall page structure, likely including shared elements like sidebars and navbars.
- **Route Groups (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(pages)`, `(parent)`, `(student)`):** Organize routes based on functionality or user roles. This helps in applying specific layouts or middleware to sections of the app.
- **Page Components (`page.tsx`):** Represent individual pages within the application (e.g., Dashboard, User Management, Settings). Many pages currently use placeholder content, indicating ongoing development.
- **API Routes (`src/app/.../api/`):** Although not explicitly reviewed, Next.js convention suggests API routes might exist within the `app` directory for server-side logic or backend communication proxies.

### UI Components (`src/components`)
- **Shared UI (`src/components/ui`):** Contains the Shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.).
- **Admin Panel Components (`src/components/admin-panel`, `src/components/admin-panel-parent`):** Specific layout components like sidebars, navbars, and content layouts for different admin views.
- **Feature-Specific Components:** Components tailored for specific features like forms (`login-form.tsx`, `enrollment-form.tsx`), data tables (`enrollments-data-table.tsx`), charts (`dashboard-area-chart.tsx`), etc.
- **Authentication Components (`src/components/auth-side.tsx`, `*-form.tsx`):** Components related to login, registration, password reset, etc.

### State Management (`src/contexts`, `src/hooks`)
- **`AuthContext.tsx`:** Manages user authentication state, login/logout logic, registration, and related functions like OTP verification and aptitude test status checks. Uses React Context API.
- **Custom Hooks (`src/hooks`):** Provide reusable logic, such as `useAuth` for accessing auth context, `use-sidebar` for managing sidebar state, and data fetching hooks (e.g., `useEnrollments`, `useStudyPlans` - inferred from page components) likely using SWR.

### Utilities and Libraries (`src/lib`)
- **`api-client.ts`:** Configured Axios instance for making requests to the backend API. Includes interceptors for adding auth tokens and basic error handling (like redirecting on 401). Supports mock data fallback.
- **`menu-list.ts`:** Defines the navigation structure for the admin sidebar.
- **`utils.ts`:** Likely contains general utility functions (e.g., `cn` for class names).
- **`schemas.ts`, `validations/`:** Define Zod schemas for data validation, particularly for forms.
- **API Abstractions (`auth-api.ts`, `enrollment-api.ts`, etc.):** Files dedicated to specific API interactions.

### Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`, `src/middleware-*.ts`)
- Handles request processing before reaching the page, likely for authentication checks, authorization based on user roles, or redirecting users based on certain conditions (e.g., aptitude test completion).

## Data Flow
1.  **User Interaction:** User interacts with UI components (e.g., clicks a button, fills a form).
2.  **Component Logic:** Event handlers in components trigger actions.
3.  **State Update:** State managed by React Context (`AuthContext`) or custom hooks (using SWR, Zustand) is updated.
4.  **API Request:** For data fetching or mutations, components or hooks use the `api-client` (Axios) to send requests to the backend API (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`). Authentication tokens are automatically added via interceptors.
5.  **API Response:** Backend processes the request and sends a response.
6.  **State Update & Re-render:** SWR or other state management updates the local state based on the API response, causing relevant components to re-render with new data or UI changes.
7.  **Validation:** Forms use React Hook Form and Zod schemas (`src/lib/schemas`, `src/lib/validations`) for client-side validation before submitting data.

## External Dependencies
- **Backend API:** `https://phpstack-732216-5200333.cloudwaysapps.com/api` (Configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`). This is the primary source of data and business logic.
- **UI Libraries:** Radix UI, Lucide Icons, Recharts.
- **Utility Libraries:** Axios, date-fns, clsx, tailwind-merge, Zod, SWR, Zustand.
