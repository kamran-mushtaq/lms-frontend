# Fixing the Lecture Path Routing Error

## Problem
The application was showing the following error:

```
Error: You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. Please check /(student)/lectures/[lectureId]/page and /lectures/[lectureId]/page.
```

This error occurred because there were two routes that Next.js considered equivalent:
1. `/app/(student)/lectures/[lectureId]/page.tsx` 
2. `/app/lectures/[lectureId]/page.tsx`

## Solution

We've implemented the following solution to keep lectures inside the (student) route group:

1. **Kept Only the Student Route**: Removed the conflicting `/app/lectures` route and kept only `/(student)/lectures/[lectureId]` as the official route.

2. **Added URL Redirects**: Implemented two types of redirects:
   - Server-side Next.js middleware redirect from `/lectures/ID` to `/student/lectures/ID`
   - .htaccess redirect for web server deployments

3. **Updated Navigation**: Ensured all navigation buttons and links use the correct `/student/lectures/[lectureId]` format.

## How It Works

1. **Direct URL Access**: 
   If a user tries to access `http://localhost:3000/lectures/67f193b59b1b2e26cc4f48f0` directly:
   - The middleware will intercept this request
   - Redirect them to `http://localhost:3000/student/lectures/67f193b59b1b2e26cc4f48f0`
   - The correct page will then load

2. **Internal Navigation**:
   - All internal links in the application now use the `/student/lectures/:id` format
   - This ensures proper routing and avoids the parallels page error

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Try to access `http://localhost:3000/lectures/67f193b59b1b2e26cc4f48f0` directly in your browser
2. You should be automatically redirected to `http://localhost:3000/student/lectures/67f193b59b1b2e26cc4f48f0`
3. The lecture content should load successfully

## Note for Developers

When creating links to lecture pages in your code, always use the format:
```typescript
router.push(`/student/lectures/${lectureId}`);
```

**DO NOT** use:
```typescript
router.push(`/lectures/${lectureId}`);
```

Although the redirect will work for users, using the correct path directly avoids unnecessary redirects and improves performance.
